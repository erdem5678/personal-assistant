* Recommended Node.js version: 18.x or higher
* React version: Use 18.2.0; React 19 will not work
* TailwindCSS: If tailwind.config.js or PostCSS settings are modified, recompile the project
* Folder structure: Ensure node_modules and package-lock.json are clean. Re-run npm install if needed
* For GitHub: Do not include node_modules (ignored via .gitignore)
